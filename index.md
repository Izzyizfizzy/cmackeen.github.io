# Welcome

![](/assets/cam_precipice.jpg)

For the past two decades I have been enrolled in school. Now I want to make the
best use of my time by following my curiousity and focusing on projects of
passion. This website will serve as my interface with the world to share what
I've done, and if *anything* here sparks thoughts worth sharing, please email
me at cammackeen@gmail.com. 

An addendum for investigative potential employers: 

As I have many interests, sometimes competing, it may seem that I may not
necessarily be an easy puzzle piece to fit into your company/organization. I do
not want to fit in as expected, and hope this can be advantageous to the
employer. The many projects I undertake demonstrate a plasticity and eagerness
to learn domain knowledge. In industry applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence the
combination of a data scientist with domain knowledge is invaluable.
