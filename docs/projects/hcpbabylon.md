 I used babylon-js to model 4 balloons covered by a tetrahedron, with one side removed so that we can peer inside. Go ahead, click and drag around! [Shift+Scroll-wheel zooms in window]. In the future I will cut the points of the tetrahedron to approach a polyhedron resmbling a round-corner tetrahedron. The plane-geometry needed to make this model turns into too much of a side-track task.
