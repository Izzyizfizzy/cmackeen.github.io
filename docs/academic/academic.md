Since childhood I have been interested in physics and specifically the concept
of time. Today, time remains important to me because of it's unbounded value.
Learning and creating takes patience; there are always too many things to do!
Through the years I pursued a path in physics to understand where our boundary
of knowledge lay.

As an undergraduate at University
of Massachussets, Amherst , I joined Professor Andrea Pocar's lab to contribute
research to project EXO ([SLAC EXO
page](https://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/exo/)). The Enriched Xenon
Observatory (EXO) is an experiment aiming to detect neutrinoless double-beta
decay, which would indicate the neutrino is its own anti-particle (an observed
Majorana fermion). The set-up consists of a time projection chamber full of
Xenon 136 that would sit deep in a mine shaft (WIP in New Mexico). To
understand the behavior of the avalanche photodiodes (APDs) at the ends of the
full-scale detector, we erected an electrically insulated ultra-high vacuum
chamber with liquid nitrogen cooling. The APD could be mounted in the chamber
and cooled, while a test source of Fe^{55} could be detected. By analyzing the singal from the APD, we calculated gain as a function of voltage bias (~1kV) and temperature. You can look at slides of [the apparatus here](/assets/apdslides.pdf).  Under the supervision of then post-doc, Dr.  Timothy Vaughn Daniels, my colleague and I learned the many facets of working on a tabletop experiment with a small team.
