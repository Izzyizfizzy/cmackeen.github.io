# Historical EXAFS
{: .no_toc }

The Bridges lab in the Physics department at University California, Santa Cruz specializes in local structure characterization using X-ray absorption techniques. Bud Bridges has collected and analyzed high quality EXAFS data for over 30 years; now it is time to learn from it all! This is a step in an effort to automate certain parts of this specialized analysis and uncover correlations between features of the materials studied and their absorption spectra.
