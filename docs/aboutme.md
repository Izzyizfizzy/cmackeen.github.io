# A Person
{: .no_toc }

I am a person named Cameron Andrew MacKeen, and received my physics PhD from
University of California, Santa Cruz in March 2019.

## Personal

![Camandre MacKeen](/assets/cam_mallorca.jpg)


I grew up in the northeast and have continuously sought to create something new
and different. Whether that is a song, or a program, or a device, or this
website!  I enjoy sailing and hope to travel to many welcoming shores; I
appreciate a cold glass of water after a hot and salty voyage. 



I have played the drum set most of my life, but in the past few years have
been singing in my band, [Salmon Hammock](http://www.soundcloud.com/salmonhammock). Also, I
have been crudely teaching myself violin.

In 2016 I joined the UC Santa Cruz ice hockey team for it's first year in the
ACHA. The second season we were much
improved and  even notched a win in the PCHA playoffs in Tahoe, I am proud of
the banana slugs who put the time into organizing this team in Santa Cruz. 

## Professional

Diverse experience
{: .text-delta }

Over my academic career I have undertaken a variety of projects, a consequence
of my curiousity. I enjoy cycles of working passionately on a project of
interest, and I am result driven. I particularly enjoy programming projects; I
have been building tools and analysis frameworks to promote quantitative
research while cutting out brute force tedium (a common grad student
experience). In research scienctists often deal with exceptional or novel
systems, so automating analysis of unknown systems is less trivial but
quite important.
