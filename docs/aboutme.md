## Personal

I grew up in the northeast and have continuously sought to create something new and different. Whether that is a song, or a program, or this website, or ....

Diverse experience
{: .text-delta }

Over my academic career I have undertaken a variety of projects, most likely a
consequence of my curiousity. I enjoy cycles of working passionately on a
project of interest, and I am result driven. I particularly enjoy programming
projects; I have been building tools and analysis frameworks to promote
thorough quantitative research while cutting out brute force tedium (a common
grad student experience).
