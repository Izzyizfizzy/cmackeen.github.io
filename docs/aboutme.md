{: .text-delta }

Over my academic career I have undertaken a variety of projects, a

project of interest, and I am result driven. I particularly enjoy programming
projects; I have been building tools and analysis frameworks to promote
quantitative research while cutting out brute force tedium (a common
grad student experience). In research science, we often deal with exceptional or novel systems, so automating analysis of unknown systems is less trivial but important.
