# Lessons Learned

As I look to share succinct content on my Projects page, I would also think it helpful to catalog the unseen obstacles, and how I stumbled through them.

## Bokeh Periodic Table
So when I dove in and configured this Jekyll template based website, I had a lot of quick css learning to do. I am inexperienced with current Jekyll template schema, and where everything is, and that important directories start with underscores. I was focused on a clean and timeless look, so I wanted to hold this core theme with how I approach plotting data visuals.

Bokeh was the answer! Maybe I am riding with some recency bias, but Bokeh is
straightforward, good-lookin', and works in both R and python. Also, templates
are widely available (and specific). Further there seems to be active community
memebers that can share their plots (thanks to Andrew Rosen), I found a decent
template of a periodic table with color maps determined by element specific
data.

What I found editing templates is that things just tend to work. This is an effeect of using python, sure, but when I had to customize the font color of the hover-menu I actually could do it with just a raw html div inside the python code.
